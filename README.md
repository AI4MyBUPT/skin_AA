This repository contains code for Automated Model for the Classification and Feature Detection of Alopecia Areata and Scalp Diseases Using Dermoscopic Images.
We developed a recognition model for common scalp diseases using dermoscopic images and an object detection model for AA dermoscopic features. 
These models provide visualization and automatic diagnostic reports, surpassing traditional methods and significantly enhancing dermatologists' diagnostic capabilities. 
This research provides an effective, convenient, and rapid diagnostic tool for scalp diseases.
